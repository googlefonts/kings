# Kings

Imagine a damsel in distress. The only hope is for the Kings Knights to rescue her from certain death. Kings Family is based on the three set font family (Kings Honor, Kings Quest and Kings Dominion). Combined to make a pro font, use this blackletter font with enchantment.

## Building the Fonts

The font is built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based, so it must be previously installed.

To install all the Python tools into a virtualenv, do the following:

From terminal:

```

cd your/local/project/directory

#once in the project folder create a virtual environment. 
This step has to be done just once, the first time:

python3 -m venv venv

#activate the virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate

#install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then run the this command:

```
cd sources
gftools builder config.yml
```
